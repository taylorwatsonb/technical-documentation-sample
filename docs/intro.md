# 👋 Hi, I'm Taylor Watson

**Technical Writer & Documentation Engineer**

I create documentation that bridges the gap between complex technology and user success. This portfolio showcases my expertise in modern documentation platforms, interactive content creation, and user-centered design.

## 🎯 **What Makes Me Different**

### **🧠 Visual Problem Solver**
I don't just write documentation—I create interactive experiences that make complex concepts accessible through:
- **ReactFlow visualizations** for workflow mapping
- **Custom mind maps** for concept breakdown
- **Interactive examples** that users can actually use

### **🚀 Modern Technical Stack**
Built with cutting-edge tools that demonstrate real-world skills:
- **Docusaurus** + **React** + **TypeScript**
- **Git workflows** and **CI/CD** integration
- **Responsive design** and **accessibility** best practices

### **📊 User-Centered Approach**
Every piece of content is designed around actual user needs:
- **Research-driven** content strategy
- **Progressive disclosure** for different skill levels
- **Multiple content formats** for diverse audiences
